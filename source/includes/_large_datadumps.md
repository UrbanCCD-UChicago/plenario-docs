## Jobs Framework

> You can invoke the Jobs interface by appending `job=true` to your query.

```
http://plenar.io/v1/api/datasets?job=true
```

>This will return a jobs ticket instead of the usual datasets endpoint. You can then use the link provided by the ticket to access the job status and results.

The [Plenario Jobs Framework](https://github.com/UrbanCCD-UChicago/plenario/pull/255) introduces support for longer-running queries on the Plenario API through an asynchronous ticket-style interface. Now endpoints which support the jobs framework can return a ticket with a link to a page which shows the job query, its status, and its result when ready.

## Plenario Datadump

> The `datadump` endpoint is housed on Plenario's backend; access it through [Plenario's Explore feature](http://plenar.io/explore/discover) by selecting a dataset and choosing Download.

Plenario Datadump is a streamlined method of downloading large (above 1000 results) data in both CSV and JSON format. Compare this to the existing `detail` endpoint; due to HTTP timeouts and other limitations, `detail` only returns a pre-specified number of rows, and it was necessary to page through these rows in order to access all the data. Instead, Plenario Datadump takes advantage of the long-running queries enabled by the Jobs Framework to dump the entire query into a file, allowing the query to be downloaded later as one unit. Plenario Datadump is located at the `/datadump` endpoint, and takes the same query parameters as `detail`. `jobs=true` is implied, so you do not need to use it explicitly.
