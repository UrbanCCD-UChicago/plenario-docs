# **Event & Shape Data**

Because Event and Shape datasets are similar in structure
(they're both tabular)
they share many of the same query options.
We cover them together in this section.

Sensor network data, on the other hand, is not tabular.
It comes in to Plenario as a stream of data, not a tabular file.
So queries against sensor networks look a bit different,
and will be covered in the next section
