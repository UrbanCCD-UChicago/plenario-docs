# Sensor Network Data

> A sensor node (represented as GeoJSON)

```json
{
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            -87.6298,
            41.8781
        ]
    },
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "info": {
			"orientation": "NE",
			"height_in_meters": "5"
		},
        "sensors": ["tmp421", "hmc5883l"],
        "network_name": "array_of_things",
        "id": "011"
    }
}
```
Plenario lets you fetch data from sensor networks in different ways, depending on the needs of your application.

If you're developing an application to let people explore data
(like [OpenGrid](https://chicago.opengrid.io/opengrid/)
or Plenario's [demonstration application](http://plenar.io/sensors))
the [query and aggregate endpoints](#http-data-queries)
are designed to respond quickly, making them a good fit for web applications.

If you want to mirror the data from a network,
you can use our [Websocket API](#streaming-data-queries) to receive all of a network's data as it arrives in Plenario.
The Websocket API is also helpful for applications that send real-time notifications
and for real-time dashboards.

And if you want a bulk export to load into your own database,
you can use our [download endpoint](#bulk-data-export)
to specify the time period and sensors you're interested in,
and Plenario will generate a flat file with that data.

### Sensor Network Structure

> A feature of interest with a single observed property

```json
{
  "name": "temperature",
  "observed_properties": [
	{
	  "type": "float",
	  "name": "temperature",
	  "unit": "Degrees Celsius",
	  "description": "external air temperature"
	}
  ]
}
```

> A feature of interest with three observed properties, representing a three-dimensional magnetic field vector

```json
{
	"name": "magnetic_field",
	"observed_properties": [
	    {
	        "type": "float",
	        "name": "x",
			"unit": "gauss"
	    },
	    {
	        "type": "float",
	        "name": "y",
			"unit": "gauss"
	    },
	    {
	        "type": "float",
	        "name": "z",
			"unit": "gauss"
	    }
	]
}
```

To make queries against sensor networks,
it will help to understand how Plenario structures sensor data.
It uses the hierarchy of a network to let you drill down to the data you want to see,
filtering by type of sensor, location of nodes, and more.

![metadatamodel](images/sensor-overview.svg)

Each sensor network in Plenario has _nodes_, devices installed at some physical location.
Nodes have _sensors_ that report on physical properties like temperature.
Sensors report _observations_ that contain a timestamp and one or more values.

To make it easier to query across different sensors,
Plenario uses the concept of _features of interest_.
Features of interest define properties that different sensors can report on.
For example, if the `tempy9000` and `tempmaster_mach2` sensors both report on temperature,
you can query on the `temperature` feature of interest to find temperature observations
instead of finding and specifying every temperature sensor in the network.

Features of interest also define the meaning of observations.
So you're guaranteed that two sensors reporting under `temperature`
will have the same unit of measurement (Celsius).

### Querying Data

> A sensor observation, reporting on `magnetic_field`.

```json
{
	"feature_of_interest": "magnetic_field",
	"node_id": "029",
	"sensor": "hmc5883l",
	"meta_id": 11,
	"results": {
		"x": 0.602,
		"y": 0.613,
		"z": 0.604
	},
	"datetime": "2016-12-25T00:54:18"
}
```

You can query sensor data much like you can query tabular data,
filtering by time and space and performing aggregations.
Unlike tabular data, you can also stream incoming sensor data over Websockets.

### Querying Metadata

You can also query metadata - networks, nodes, sensors, and features of interest.
The existing metadata endpoints tells you everything you need to know to form a valid data query -
What are all the nodes that have ever been in this network?
What are all the sensors that have ever been installed on a node?

Currently in development is support for more detailed metadata
that lets you dig in to how an observation was derived -
What constants were used to calibrate this sensor at the time of this observation?
What sensors were installed on this node at the time of this observation?

### Common Query Syntax

> Query over January 2017

```
&start_datetime=2017-1-1&end_datetime=2017-2-1
```

For endpoints that allow time filtering, you can provide the query parameters `start_datetime` (observation date greater than or equal to) and `end_datetime` (less than or equal to). Both must be formatted in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss, to whatever precision you desire).
Note that sensor observations are reported in
[Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
