## Metadata Queries

The sensor network metadata endpoints give you all the information you need
to construct valid queries on sensor data.
Note that the metadata from these endpoints doesn't necessarily
represent the current configuration of each sensor network.
For example, if a node is up for a year and then removed,
that node will still be visible in the `/nodes` endpoint.
That way, you can still find it and query the data collected while it was up.
Similarly, if a sensor is removed from a node,
that sensor will still be visible in that node's `sensors` property.

### Responses

| **Attribute Name** | **Attribute Description**       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **query**          | Shows values used in the query. |
| **message**        | Reports warnings (if any).      |
| **total**          | Total number of records found.  |
| **data**           | Contains records                |
| **error**          | Contains any errors             |

Either the **data** or **error** field will be returned, but not both.

## -- Sensor Networks

`sensor-networks/<network>`

Retrieve metadata about one or many sensor networks that publish observations to Plenario.
If no network is specified, metadata for
all sensor networks will be returned.

A sensor network is a collection of sensor nodes maintained by one organization.
Within a sensor network's metadata,
you can find the IDs of nodes within the network
and all of the features of interest those nodes report on.
With this information, you can launch queries on features of interest or drill down further into the metadata by node.

A feature of interest defines properties of the world that sensors observe,
like temperature or traffic.
Every observation is tagged with a feature of interest,
which determines how the observation is formatted.
A feature called `traffic_count` might be composed of _observed properties_
called `pedestrians`, `cars`, and `bicycles`.
Then an observation of `traffic_count` can only report values labeled
`pedestrians`, `cars`, and `bicycles`.

A feature of interest must have one or more observed properties.
Observed properties contain metadata like
data type (float, int, boolean, or string) and unit of measurement that can help you interpret observations.
Properties only define scalar values, so for features that are vector-valued,
you will find each dimension defined as a separate feature.
For example, the definition of `magnetic_field` to the right
has separate properties for the x, y, and z dimensions.

## -- Sensors

`GET /v1/api/sensor-networks/<network>/sensors/<sensor>`

> Sensor metadata for sensor model TMP112

Retrieve metadata about sensors.
If no sensor is specified, returns all sensors from the specified network.

```

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "query": {

A sensor is a piece of equipment that generates observations.
Every observation is tagged with the sensor that generated it.
The `info` object in sensor metadata contains general metadata
like a link to the sensor's datasheet.
The `properties` list contains all of the _observed_properties_
that the sensor reports on, written as <feature>.<observed_property>.
It is not enough to specify just the feature,
because some sensors may report on only a subset of a feature's properties.
